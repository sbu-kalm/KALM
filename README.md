KALM is a system that allows domain experts to author logical knowledge using controlled natural language. It was designed to enable the translation of factual English sentences into logical representations that knowledge representation systems can utilize for reasoning and querying. However, interacting with KALM currently requires complex command line inputs, creating a usability barrier. The goal of this research is to develop an intuitive graphical user interface for KALM to improve its accessibility, with features for submitting training data, viewing extracted logical frames, and potentially even asking and answering questions. The interface aims to enable domain experts without technical backgrounds to leverage KALM's capabilities.
